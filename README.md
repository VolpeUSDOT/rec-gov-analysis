# Recreation.gov Historical Reservations Analysis tools

This repository contains tools to help analyze and use open recreation.gov reservation data for transportation and recreation planning. The Volpe Center developed these tools to help develop a summary for the U.S. Forest Service of how this reservation data could be used in transportation planning within national forests.

## Known Issues
This code was developed for the specific purpose of assisting with an internal analysis and is provided as-is in the hope that others working with this data will find the tools useful and be able to build from them for their own needs. These reservations are a rich data source that could benefit from additional analysis beyond the scope of these exploratory tools, especially geospatial analysis.

We welcome contributions back to this code base to improve these tools for other users. All code contributions are subjects to the public domain license and conditions described in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Data
The historical reservation data is available from Recreation.gov [here](https://ridb.recreation.gov/?action=datadownload).
